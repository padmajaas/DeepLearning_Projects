Goal : Given text for Questions , predict tags associated with them 

DataPreparation:  The P1_Multiclass_Multilabel.ipynb is the file that has the data preparation part. The data is cleaned and EDA part is done and stored in the file mcml_final.csv.

Datamodelling:  mcml_DLModel_new.ipynb is the file that contains the DeepLearning Data Model. 
Since the datamodelling took a lot of time the weights have been stored in the file .hdf5 files.
stackoverflow_tags.hdf5 is the weights for the validation data.
stackoverflow_tags_finalTest.hdf5 is the weights file for the finalTest data.
